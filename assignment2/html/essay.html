<!-- This bit is just my essay/artist statement meant to better explain the project -->

<div id="essay">
<p>
First to begin: I would like to state that this website was created from the perspective of a non-indigenous person based on research. In no means am I as an artist making assumptions on indigenous identity based on what I have learned. Not all folks who identify as indigenous have to speak their language or hunt as the website may suggest. Identity is a personal phenome that can be defined however you as the individual choose. This website was more to touch on general topics that relate to much deeper facets that can apply to identity such as language, legal status specifically related to the Canadian Indian Act (in the time frame prior to 1985) as well as the connection and interactions with the land.

</p>



<p>
The fieldwork I have chosen to base my project on is a series of three paintings which make up the Trilogy of St James by Cree artist Kent Monkman. The paintings follow a tragic gay love story between a white colonialist and an indigenous man dressed in a headdress, silky loincloth and platform high heels. Monkman, influenced by Foucault’s notion of sexuality as an exchange of power, painted the paintings using sexuality as well as humor to comment on the roles of indigenous peoples within history. Often inserting his own drag persona/ alter-ego, Miss Chief Share Eagle Testickle, into his own paintings. The three paintings starting from the pair running off together, to the colonialist being faced by a firing squad as his lover is overcome with despair, to the funeral where the indigenous man on horseback in black pumps as another indigenous man dressed as a priest looks onto the headstone.

These painting caused me to reflect on how indigenous peoples view and identify themselves and how that differs from how they are defined by other perspectives. Within this interactive website, the user is invited to explore how their choices reflect a certain perspective on identity pertaining either to the relationships indigenous peoples have with their ancestral lands, The Indian Act, specifically prior to 1985 and Indigenous Languages and Culture. Land is a pivotal part of indigenous culture and identity. Many nations place significance on living on the same land their ancestors grew up on, making it a part of their identity. As Leanne Simpson wrote in her article, “Our spirituality, identities, languages and systems of governance come from the land.” (Simpson, Pg. 15) In relation to legal identity, the Canadian Indian Act there were many limitations on what status Indians were entitled to. Moreover, on how easy it was to lose one’s status and the consequences of that such as having to move off of the reserve or being unable to pass legal status onto one’s children. (Cannon, Pg. 38) This labelling of status versus non-status created a sort divide within indigenous communities as there were struggles in how to identify one’s self based on whether or not an individual possessed status. (Cannon, Pg. 43) Language is an important part of indigenous identity as it allows for connection to knowledge systems and culture in a different way. (Battiste, Pg. 194) All three of these perspectives often overlap but are also quite different from each other.

Each step in the website is symbolic of these three perspectives. The first stage, the user must speak Cree in order to advance to represent the connection to indigenous language. However, an interesting occurrence while coding the website revealed that the code library I had used did not recognize Cree but understood English but “heard” it as Japanese. I thought this was truly interesting in terms of space for indigenous peoples in the web as their native languages are not recognizes. The second stage involves writing in indigenous language as well. Once again in relation to the connection between language and identity. The third stage has to do with being recognized as having Indian Status under the Indian Act, specifically prior to 1985. The user cannot advance without checking all three boxes to represent how indigenous peoples had to satisfy specific criteria in order to gain status. The fourth part, where the user is “fishing” you may notice that not all the fish are able to be collected. This is to reflect how indigenous peoples respect the land and have a strong connection to it, careful not to deplete the resources. The final stage reflects how easy it is to lose status in ways one may not even think of. The site was mainly meant for a non-indigenous audience in order to bring awareness and education on issues they may not know much about.

</p>


<p>
The “identity meter” which is an avatar which fills with green, to reflect indigenous identity, and red, to reflect legal identity, fills and empties respectively as the user goes through the site and their actions reflect either indigenous or legal identity. Another addition to the site was the use of a British sounding voice when the legal status was lost in the final stage of the site to reflect the British colonialists.


</p>


<p>
Though the topic of identity is extremely complicated and a very personal matter, the website was meant to provide a sort of overview. How indigenous peoples choose to identify themselves is purely their own decision and may not even be in relation to the three perspectives reflected in this project. Land, language or the Indian Act may not be the basis of how indigenous peoples choose to identify themselves. However, the most important point is how indigenous peoples choose to identify is their own choice and cannot be defined by standards other their own personal ones.
