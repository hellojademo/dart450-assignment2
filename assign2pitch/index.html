    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
    <p>
        Assignment 2 will be a done in combination with my ANTH 204- First Peoples of North America course. In this course, the historical and current cultural, social and systemic conditions which affect indigenous peoples are examined. One concept which is of particular interest is the contrast between the European narrative of indigenous histories compared to the actual history as described by the peoples themselves. The way of life of Europeans was so much more rigid, structured and rule based compared to the more free-flowing connectedness of the indigenous peoples. This is not the case for every single tribe but there are definite differences.

      <p>
        I will be basing my website design on research done for the Anthropology class. I will be visually representing the contrast between rigid European society and connected indigenous society. I will be creating a web page with two sides, one that functions very linearly and the other interconnected in a loop. The Scroll Magic library will become quite useful in having elements appearing at certain points. Further feedback from peers and the professor will help me to iron out final details to successfully represent such a complex concept.
